Hey there! This post is just a beginning of our project, that's called **Expense Tracking App** at the moment.

We're planning to share with you early wireframes, designs, our plans, and even failures. We want to be honest with you and open for discussions. 

## Why another app?

You're right! There are so many applications for personal finance management, but most of them have a lot of features, that we don't need. So, our idea is to create a pretty simple version. Ideally, you add expense or income, and we count everything for you.

Another thing we want to do, is to make it available for anyone for free. This project is going to be an open source solution, so any developer will be able to help us to improve something.

## Don't you already have something?

We do, but it's not really good. The first version of the app was implemented for fun, we didn't even think about the business logic, so we came up with a beautiful design, that doesn't make any sense, because we can only provide expenses, without any information about income üòÑ 

Here is the design of that application, if you're interested.

Another issue we had is that we were thinking about making this app easy to use with keyboard, but we forgot that so many people are using just mouse, to do some action ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## What's the plan?

The plan is pretty simple, we'll start from the beginning, and implement only features that we really need. If you want to add some feature to the app, please, let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ExpenseApp) or our "Ideas" section on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/expenseapp-io/rfcs/discussions/categories/ideas)

We promised to share with you everything, so here is the Dashboard wireframe ‚ò∫Ô∏è You can always share your ideas or suggestions with us. We'd love to hear anything from you!
